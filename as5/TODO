Need to add more specific error messages EVERYWHERE

Duplicate names in a record?

NIL!!

I think I am handling h wrong
I think all of the mutually recursive functions need to have a parameter for if it is in a loop

Still need to handle the break statements

TODO: Do I need the ! for checking record or array equality?

Cannot re-define types (still need to do for var and function too)....hmm placeholder for functions?
