TODO

I need to fill in the move stuff for the liveness graph

I could have done foldr and foldl for a lot of these but I chose to go with recursive functions

Had a bug where I was always looking for next instruction when there might not be one

What happens with the redefinition of a variable? Is that treated as a different temporary?

What counts as a successor of a node? All of the things that come after or just the direct thing? I'm going to assume it's the altter

Do I need to optimize by doing the reverse?

Part b) fixed a bug where the instruction that jumped didn't have the proper fall-through edge too

Part c) What about variables with 0-length liveness?
