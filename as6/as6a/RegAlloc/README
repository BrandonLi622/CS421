Part a) The example input that I am using for my program is:
a := 0
b := a + 1
c := c + b
a := b * 2

Not the most interesting program, but you can verify that the output is correctly
based on the interference graph construction algorithm and graph coloring algorithm.

The resulting liveness graph should be based on:

                  1st        2nd
   use def     out   in   out   in   
------------------------------------
4  b   a    |        b          b
3  bc  c    |  b     bc   b     bc
2  a   b    |  bc    ac   bc    ac
1      a    |  ac    c    ac    c

Suppose k=2, we can assign the colors:
a -> reg1
b -> reg1
c -> reg2

Since the interference graph kind of looks like this:

(A)  (B)
 |   /
 |  /
 | /
(C)
