The different set of keywords, operators, and other symbols needs support from new transition
rules (e.g., allowing things like @ symbols in annotations or ? : as a conditional operator),
and there also needs to be support for Java's larger set of data types (although, I suppose in 
principle a float can just be outputted as an int token followed by a DOT token and then another
int token, although scientific notations till needs to somehow be separately handle). 
Also, more escape sequences need to be allowed for, and instead of \ddd where each
d is a decimal digit, Java supports octal escapes (so this would have to be changed). Java also
does not allow nested comments, so this functionality would have to be taken out.

Then, specifically in terms of handling Java's use of UTF-16 encoded Unicode characters, since
Unicode is much larger than the Ascii set, we need to allow more characters inside
strings and comments. Also, since Java also represents single characters as 'c' where c is a
character, it would be nice to have a character token as well (though again, that could probably
be specified as a single quote token followed by an ID token followed by a single quote token as
well and just be passed off to the semantic analyzer for error detection). In form, Java ID's
are very similar to those of Tiger's (in that it starts with some sort of "letter" and then is
followed by any sequence of "letters" and "numbers", although Java defines letters to include
a slightly larger character set than just alphabetic characters), but Java does allow Unicode
characters to be in ID's, so this would need to be supported in the regular expression matchings.

From the specification: "Except for comments (§3.7), identifiers, and the contents of character 
and string literals (§3.10.4, §3.10.5), all input elements (§3.5) in a program are formed only from 
ASCII characters (or Unicode escapes (§3.3) which result in ASCII characters)." So beyond the
cases that we already specified, none of the other lexing would need to be changed.
