The different set of keywords, operators, and other symbols needs support from new transition
rules (e.g., allowing things like @ symbols in annotations or ? : as a conditional operator),
and there also needs to be support for Java's larger set of data types (although, I suppose in 
principle a float can just be outputted as an int token followed by a DOT token and then another
int token, although scientific notations till needs to somehow be separately handle). 
Also, more escape sequences need to be allowed for, and instead of \ddd where each
d is a decimal digit, Java supports octal escapes (so this would have to be changed). Java also
does not allow nested comments, so this functionality would have to be taken out.

Then, specifically in terms of handling Java's use of UTF-16 encoded Unicode characters, since
Unicode is much larger than the Ascii set, we need to allow more characters inside
strings and comments. Also, since Java also represents single characters as 'c' where c is a
character, it would be nice to have a character token as well (though again, that could probably
be specified as a single quote token followed by an ID token followed by a single quote token as
well and just be passed off to the semantic analyzer for error detection). The allowance of Unicode
characters does not change how ID's are formed.
