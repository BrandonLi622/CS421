The only terminal that I added was UMINUS (which stands for unary minus), and the purpose
of this was in order to use the %prec feature to be able to give the unary minus a
higher precedence than the other arithmetic operators.

I added a number of nonterminals that corresponded to the different types of valid
"expressions" as they are defined in Appendix A of the textbook. 

I started with 110 shift-reduce conflicts (never had to deal with any reduce-reduce conflicts),
and most of them were pretty straightforward to eliminate by adding in precedence rules.
The trickiest parts were dealing with if-then-else vs. if-then, and array creation vs.
accessing an array as part of an lvalue. For the if-then-else problem, I just had to create
another precedence rule that favored shifting towards if-then-else. For the second problem,
I had to change the lvalue rule so that it did not do left recursion before it would be able
to check for an "OF" token, just so that it could defer the decision that led to a shift-reduce
conflict until checking to see if the OF token is really there.

I tried left-factoring in some places but it didn't really seem to do much good, so I took
most of the left-factoring out.

As a quick explanation of the precedence rules, I took the operator ones from the book,
and then decided that & and | should be left-associative because it seems that a & b & c is a 
valid Tiger program based on the examples.
